# Zombie Master: Reborn - Game Folder

This is the game folder of ZMR. This repository does not include the binaries. See [zmr-game](https://github.com/zm-reborn/zmr-game)-repository.

You can run the `zmr_dev_setup.ps1`-script to setup this folder to run the game.

## Building VPKs

VPKs need to be built with the `-M`-parameter. `-P` should not be used alone, because Linux fails to load the vpk otherwise.
